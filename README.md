### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Suchetan, an Electrical and Electronics undergraduate at BITS Pilani, Goa. I've been facinated with robots ever since I learned about them.

Navigation, planning and perception is what I love to work on. 
I'm currently pursuing my thesis in the field of Active SLAM at ISAE-SUPAERO as a part of the NaVIRE2S team. I hold a position of responsibility in Project Kratos, a mars rover research project. I'm currently improvising on robotic perception and actively participating in projects related to SLAM and perception aware planning.
I'm a huge embedded systems fan. I love working with microcontrollers. 

If you are looking to collaborate with me on any autonomy based project, do hit me up :D

Please do checkout my repositories to get a better idea of my work :)
