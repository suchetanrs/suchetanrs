### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Suchetan, an Electrical and Electronics undergraduate at BITS Pilani, Goa. I've been facinated with robots ever since I learned about them.

Control systems, planning and perception is what I love to work on. 
I hold a position of responsibility in Project Kratos, a mars rover research project. I'm currently improvising on robotic perception and actively participating in projects related to SLAM and perception aware planning.
I'm a huge embedded systems fan. I love working with microcontrollers. 

If you are looking to collaborate with me on any autonomy based project, do hit me up :D

Please do checkout my repositories to get a better idea of my work :)

You can always reach out to me via email: rssuchetan@gmail.com
